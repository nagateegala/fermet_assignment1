# DESCRIPTION
Mathematician Pierre Fermat proved that no arbitrary natural numbers x, y, and z could satisfy the equation x^n+y^n=z^n where n is a natural number above 2. This program searches for values of z given integers x and y greater than 10 (and less than a specified user input value k) that satisfy the above equation, noting misses, that is the distance from the true z value to the nearest integer value. In running this program, providing a bound on the x and y values as well as an n value, it will search for misses and output the conditions under which the miss was discovered every time a smaller relative miss size percentage is found.

# INSTALLATION
This program uses the Java Runtime Enrivonment to run the Fermat.jar file. The user should have this installed alongside the .jar file on their machine. To run the program, a user needs to open their command prompt, set the directory to the location of the .jar file, and enter the line "java -jar Fermat.jar". This will present a set of instructions and allow the user to begin their input of the program.
  
# INSTRUCTIONS
This program follows searches for the nearest smallest miss between the values of x^n + y^n and z^n. Upon running the program, the user will be prompted for a value for n as seen in the formula between 2 and 12 exclusive, after which the user will also be prompted for a value for k, which determines all tested integers that x and y can be, which is greater than 10 and less than k, inclusive. The upper bound of what k can be will be determined on what the user inputs for n, so as to keep the formula for Fermat's near-misses from being too bloated of values for the machine to handle. The program will run until it goes through all possible x and y values, displaying the next nearest miss each time it encounters it. After this process, the program will end, and the user will need to run the program again to enter new values in. 
  
The user also has the option of viewing the output of the program in the generated text file "small_output.txt" upon running entirely.
